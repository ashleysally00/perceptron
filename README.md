### Intro
You might have heard people talking about machine learning‚Äôs deep neural networks. They make things like facial recognition on your phone or the voice assistant in your smart speaker possible. But did you know that the first artificial neural network was invented in the 1950s?
It was called the Perceptron, and it laid the foundation for modern AI, including deep learning and today‚Äôs most powerful neural networks. However, it had serious limitations that prevented it from solving more complex problems.

### What Was the Perceptron?

The Perceptron was one of the first artificial neural networks, invented by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. It was designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information and was one of the earliest examples of machine learning.
How It Worked:
The Perceptron was a simple, single-layer neural network that could take input (like images of letters) and learn to classify them.
It used weighted connections between "neurons" (similar to how brain cells connect).
It could adjust these weights based on errors, allowing it to learn over time.
This allowed it to recognize handwritten letters, making it an early step toward AI-based handwriting recognition.

### What Could the Perceptron Do?
‚úÖ It could separate things into two categories, like:
Apples vs. Oranges
Spam vs. Not Spam
Cats vs. Dogs

üö´ What It Couldn‚Äôt Do
It couldn‚Äôt make complex decisions beyond simple yes/no classifications.
It failed at recognizing patterns that required more than a straight-line separation‚Äîlike the XOR problem
